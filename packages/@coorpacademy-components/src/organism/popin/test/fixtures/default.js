        How to use the e-training platform</h2>
        For the etraining we recommend that you first review the course material in the right hand menu to help you answer the questions. The course material changes every time you progress to a new chapter within a module. You gain stars for all main course videos or PDFs that you view, the questions that you answer correctly and also when you win challenges. The more stars you gain, the greater chance you will have to rank amongst the top 20 participants of the etraining. You lose a life if you answer a question incorrectly, and if you lose three lives you have to repeat the chapter – but also remember you can gain a life back if you review the main course PDF or Video of the chapter again.
        We strongly recommend that you read the instructions on how to use the platform.  The Course Instructions are available in the footer menu on the bottom of every page and also through the left side menu.
